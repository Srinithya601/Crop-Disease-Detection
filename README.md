## Project Title

**Crop Disease Detection through Leaf Image Classification**

In agriculture, leaf diseases pose a serious threat to crop yield and quality. Early and accurate identification can help mitigate losses. This project introduces an automated image classification model to identify diseases in specific crops using deep learning.

---

##  Problem Statement

Diseases on crop leaves can drastically affect productivity, leading to economic setbacks, especially in agriculture-driven countries. Manual detection is time-consuming, inconsistent, and requires expertise. This project aims to automate disease detection to:

- Aid farmers with instant diagnosis.
- Reduce crop loss due to delayed identification.
- Enhance precision agriculture practices.

---

##  Project Description

This deep learning model classifies leaf images into disease categories using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**, enhanced with **pretrained AlexNet weights** for efficient and accurate feature extraction.

### Key Steps:

- **Image Acquisition**  
  Leaf images are captured in real time with a white background for improved contrast and segmentation.

- **Image Preprocessing**  
  Images are resized and normalized using interpolation and batch normalization.

- **Feature Extraction**  
  CNN layers automatically extract features from the images, reducing dimensionality using max pooling and dropout.

- **Model Training**  
  Using Keras and TensorFlow, pretrained layers are frozen while custom layers are trained. Hyperparameters are tuned for performance.

- **Image Classification**  
  Based on patterns like color, density, and texture, CNN classifies the image into one of the 38 disease categories.

- **Web App with Flask**  
  A simple web interface is created using Flask (with HTML/CSS/JS) to allow users to upload images and receive predictions.

- **Deployment on Heroku**  
  The app is deployed using **Heroku**, with model files stored via Git LFS due to large file size (~124MB). Continuous integration is configured for seamless updates.

ðŸ”—  Assumptions

- The model currently supports **15 crops** and **38 diseases** (specific classes trained).
- It only classifies **predefined crops and disease types**.
